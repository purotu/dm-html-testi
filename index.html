  <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and allows you to easily revert back to previous versions.</p>
  <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.</p>

  <h2>Features of Git</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Version Control: Git allows you to track changes to your files, making it easy to revert back to previous versions if needed.</li>
    <li>Branching and Merging: Git enables you to create branches to work on different features or experiments, and later merge them back into the main codebase.</li>
    <li>Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration among multiple developers by providing a centralized repository where everyone can contribute their changes.</li>
    <li>Conflict Resolution: Git helps in resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple developers make changes to the same file simultaneously.</li>
    <li>History and Blame: Git maintains a detailed history of all changes made to the codebase, allowing you to easily track who made specific changes.</li>
